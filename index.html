            <h2>Welcome to the D-D Home Page</h2>
            <p>D-D Farm is not a petting zoo, or a zoo of any sort. D-D is not open to the public, so do not come uninvited or without notice. D-D was officially founded in 1999, and is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, licensed by USDA and the Missouri conservation department. We are wildlife rehabbers, take in orphaned or unwanted wildlife and return it to the wild, and take in exotic animals as space is available. We hold two open houses as fundraisers a year, open doors for four hours twice a year. If you are interested in volunteering, contact D-D for more information, but it is showed up on an appointment based schedule. D-D is set up on 15 acres of land, which allows for enclosures to be larger than required size.</p>
